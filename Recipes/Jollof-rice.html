    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce or blended tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth or water</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: cooked vegetables or meat (chicken, beef, shrimp)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and red bell pepper, and saut√© until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce or blended tomatoes to the pot. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the thyme, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
